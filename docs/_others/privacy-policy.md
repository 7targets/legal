If you choose to connect a Gmail account to 7Targets, while creating the Assistant, we will ask you to grant 7Targets application permissions to access your Gmail account.

In particular, we will need to access to send emails on your behalf as well to detect replies to emails that have been sent via 7Targets.

Our servers only store emails that you have sent via 7Targets and any responses you have received to those emails so we can detect replies, classify them, and provide access to them in your 7Targets account. All data obtained via Gmail API is available in your 7Targets account.

Also, we will store your authentication token and account email address and name. This data will be securely stored to be used by 7Targets to provide you with the Services (including but not limited to logging into your account, sending emails via the 7Targets platform, accessing emails you sent, and viewing replies you received to these emails).
